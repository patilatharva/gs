# gs - git stacker

A CLI for managing stacked pull requests ðŸ¥ž

## Install

```console
brew install patilatharva/tap/gs
```

## What is gs?

gs is my fork of https://github.com/danerwilliams/charcoal, a fork of https://github.com/searleser97/graphite-cli, the Graphite CLI artifact from when it was open source.

## Quick start

### Initializing

```console
gs init
```

### Creating a new PR

```console
# Checkout the main branch
gs checkout main

# Make changes with your editor
echo "new code changes" >> file.js

# Create a branch with a single commit
#   - the -a/--all flag will stage any modified files
#   - the branch will be checked out for you
gs create -a atharva/two-way-sync

# Push changes to your remote and create a new pull request
gs submit

# If you need to make any follow up changes to the PR, you can:

# (a) amend the existing commit with gs amend
echo "more changes for first commit" >> file.js
gs amend -a

# (b) or write a new commit with gs commit
echo "changes for second commit" >> file.js
gs commit -am "Second commit."

# Submit new changes
gs submit
```

### Stacking a second PR

```console
# Open an interactive branch picker:
#
#   - select the pull request you want to stack on top of
#   - press Enter
#
# to check the branch out.
gs checkout

# Make changes with your editor
echo "Support real-time sync" > \
  real_time_sync.tsx

# Create a second PR on top of the first one
gs create -a atharva/two-way-sync-rts

# Push the stack, which will also create a 2nd pull request
# on top of the first one
gs submit
```

Visualize your new stack locally:

```console
gs log short  # or run `gs ls`
```

### Pulling the latest changes from main into your stack

```console
gs sync

# Checkout your branch
gs checkout

# Restack changes
gs restack
```

### Navigating

```console
gs up      # or `gs u`
gs down    # or `gs d`
gs top     # or `gs t`
gs bottom  # or `gs b`
```

## Developing and Running tests

You'll need to install yarn on your machine

```
npm install --global yarn
```

You'll also need to install turbo
```
npm install --global turbo
```

Build the monorepo
```
yarn install
turbo run build
```

Build the CLI

```
cd apps/cli
yarn install
yarn build
```

Running tests

```
cd apps/cli
DEBUG=1 yarn test --full-trace
```

Running a subset of tests

```
cd apps/cli
DEBUG=1 yarn test --full-trace -g "test pattern"
```

Running one test

```
cd apps/cli
DEBUG=1 yarn test-one "<path to .js test file in dist folder>"
```

Running the CLI locally (after build)

```
cd apps/cli
yarn cli <command> # (to run `gs <command>`)
```

Linking `gs` to a locally built version (includes a build)

```
cd apps/cli
yarn dev
# then to run commands:
gs <command>
```
